# Course Assets

Drop lab-ready files (datasets, screenshots, transcripts) in this folder when tailoring the accelerator to your organisation. The default curriculum references:

- Datasets – CSVs and golden datasets used in Modules 1 and 2
- Dashboards – Power BI exports for Module 3
- Code – Legacy COBOL snippets for Module 4

Replace the placeholders with anonymised or synthetic versions that reflect your environment.
