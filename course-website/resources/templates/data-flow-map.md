# Data & Batch Flow Map

## Batch Steps (from JCL)
| Step | Proc | Program | Reads | Writes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Entity / Field Catalog
| Field | Definition | Format/Length | Source | Transform | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

> Tip: Map JCL steps to COBOL modules to trace read/write dependencies. This is why analysts examine both JCL and COBOL. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
