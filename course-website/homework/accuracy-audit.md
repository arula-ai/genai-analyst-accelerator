# Homework: Accuracy Audit Cycle

**Module Alignment:** Module 5 – Governance & Accuracy Fundamentals

## Goal

Run the hallucination response workflow on intentionally flawed outputs. Capture evidence, escalation messages, and improvement actions.

## Assets

- Sample incidents: Use the scenarios documented in the Hallucination Response Playbook on the Governance page.
- Accuracy register: `governance/accuracy-register-template.csv`
- Bias checklist: Apply the Bias & Validation Checklist shown in Resources.

## Deliverables

1. **Incident Reports** – Two completed worksheets (one data-focused, one narrative-focused).
2. **Updated Accuracy Register** – CSV file with new rows documented.
3. **Escalation Message** – Draft email or chat message using the template.
4. **Retrospective Notes** – Short write-up of lessons learned and proposed process tweaks.

## Instructions

1. Review the provided flawed outputs (facilitator will supply or create your own).
2. Score each incident using the severity table in the playbook.
3. Execute the response workflow—pause, capture, assess, respond, close.
4. Update the accuracy register with artifact details, evidence links, and outcome.
5. Draft an escalation message appropriate to the severity.
6. Summarise improvements for prompts, validation, or governance cadence.
7. Submit artifacts in `accuracy-audit-<your-name>`.

## What to Submit

- `incident-report-data.md`
- `incident-report-narrative.md`
- `accuracy-register.csv`
- `escalation-message.txt`
- `retro-notes.md`

## Review Criteria

- Severity scoring matches the issue described.
- Evidence and validations are attached or referenced.
- Escalation communication is concise and actionable.
- Retrospective notes drive real governance improvements.
