**Objective:** Learn to use Copilot's critique capability to identify and fix gaps in your requirements artifacts

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to systematically review user stories for quality
- Techniques for identifying ambiguities and missing requirements
- Patterns of common requirements gaps
- How to apply INVEST criteria through AI assistance

### 2. Build a Mini Requirements Traceability Matrix  
**File:** `rtm-exercise.md`  
**Time Estimate:** 30-45 minutes  
**Objective:** Create an automated traceability matrix that links source documentation through to UAT test cases

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to extract requirements from source documents systematically
- Creating bidirectional traceability between artifacts
- Automated gap analysis for requirements coverage
- Documentation standards for regulated environments

### 3. Generate Custom Definition of Ready & Definition of Done
**File:** `dor-dod-exercise.md`  
**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes  
**Objective:** Use Copilot to create team-specific DoR and DoD checklists tailored to your environment

**What You'll Learn:**
- Customizing generic frameworks for your specific context
- Creating actionable, specific criteria
- Balancing thoroughness with practicality
- Incorporating industry-specific requirements

## Learning Objectives

By completing all homework assignments, you will:

1. **Master Quality Review Techniques**
   - Use AI to systematically identify gaps in requirements
   - Apply structured critique methodologies
   - Improve story quality through iterative refinement

2. **Build Traceability Discipline**
   - Create and maintain requirements traceability matrices
   - Link all artifacts from source to test
   - Perform automated gap analysis

3. **Customize Frameworks**
   - Adapt generic best practices to your specific environment
   - Create actionable team standards
   - Balance rigor with practical constraints

4. **Develop AI Collaboration Skills**
   - Use Copilot for critical analysis, not just content generation
   - Apply the five-part prompt pattern consistently
   - Maintain professional judgment while leveraging AI assistance

## How to Submit (Optional)

These assignments are designed for your own professional development. However, if you'd like feedback:

1. **Share with Peers:** Exchange homework with colleagues who attended the session
2. **Team Review:** Present your DoR/DoD to your team for feedback
3. **Manager Discussion:** Use your RTM as a starting point for process improvement conversations

## Success Criteria

You'll know you've succeeded when:

- [ ] Your refined stories pass INVEST criteria without obvious gaps
- [ ] Your RTM shows complete traceability with no orphaned requirements
- [ ] Your DoR/DoD reflects your actual environment and processes
- [ ] You can explain why each improvement was made
- [ ] You feel confident using these techniques in your daily work

## Getting Help

**Common Issues:**
- If Copilot suggestions seem generic, add more context about your specific industry/environment
- If output is too lengthy, ask for prioritized top 5-7 items
- If critique seems too harsh, ask for constructive suggestions with rationale

**Resources:**
- Reference the lab materials in `/resources` for prompt patterns
- Use the templates from your chosen path (A or B) as examples
- Check `/setup/verify-before-commit-checklist.md` for quality standards

**Questions?**
- Review the troubleshooting guide: `/resources/copilot-troubleshooting.md`
- Connect with other session attendees
- Reach out to your organization's Copilot community

## Post-Homework Next Steps

After completing these assignments:

1. **Apply at Work:** Use these techniques on your current project
2. **Share Knowledge:** Teach techniques to teammates
3. **Iterate:** Refine your prompt library based on what works
4. **Scale:** Consider how your team can adopt these practices consistently

Remember: The goal isn't to create perfect artifacts, but to build sustainable practices that improve your daily requirements work.
