# Module 5 · Governance & Accuracy Fundamentals

Run accuracy programs that keep GenAI outputs safe, traceable, and audit-ready.

## Scenario

Your team receives AI-generated SQL, narratives, and code. Some outputs are intentionally flawed. The goal is to triage incidents, capture evidence, and escalate appropriately.

## Objectives

1. Diagnose hallucinations using the bias and validation checklists.
2. Record every decision in the accuracy register with supporting evidence.
3. Draft escalation messages for risk/compliance partners when severity is high.

## What's Included

This module provides everything you need to complete the exercises:

- **Accuracy Register** – CSV template for logging decisions, evidence, and reviewers
- **Hallucination Report Template** – Incident documentation format with severity ratings
- **Response Workflow** – Steps for triaging and escalating GenAI output issues

Use the Hallucination Response Playbook (Resources page and Governance page) for additional validation techniques and escalation messaging. Update these artifacts with org-specific contacts and policies before running the program.
