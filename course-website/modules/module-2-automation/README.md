# Module 2 · Automating Everyday Data Tasks

Speed up recurring reporting tasks with GenAI while keeping a strict reviewer mindset.

## Scenario

Finance operations prepares a weekly margin report by combining order, cost, and campaign data. The goal is to automate refresh steps using synthetic datasets.

## Objectives

1. Draft Excel formulas and SQL extracts with prompt scaffolds that respect privacy guardrails.
2. Review AI-generated automation using the scorecard to decide accept/revise/reject.
3. Capture validation evidence (logs, screenshots, query IDs) for governance.

## What's Included

This module provides everything you need to complete the exercises:

- **Automation Prompts** – Excel formula and SQL extraction prompt templates
- **Review Scorecard** – Decision log for tracking automation approvals and revisions
- **Script Workspace** – Guidelines for organizing and documenting generated code

Use the Automation Cookbook (Resources page) for additional prompt patterns and privacy guardrails. Module 2 is optional but recommended once teams are comfortable with the core modules.
