# Module 1 · Prompt Engineering Essentials

Use this module to practice building prompts that produce trustworthy dataset summaries and SQL queries.

## Scenario

You have a synthetic transactions dataset for practice. Stakeholders need a quick briefing and follow-up SQL to answer retention questions.

## Objectives

1. Craft prompts using the five-part blueprint (role, inputs, constraints, format, validation).
2. Generate SQL queries that answer stakeholder questions without hallucinating tables or columns.
3. Capture validation evidence in the SQL validation log before sign-off.

## What's Included

This module provides everything you need to complete the exercises:

- **Dataset Dictionary** – Column definitions and data types for the synthetic retail transactions
- **Prompt Templates** – Pre-built prompt scaffolds for dataset briefings and SQL generation
- **Validation Log** – Template for recording query checks and reviewer approvals

Use the Prompt Clarity Blueprint (Resources page) for additional prompt patterns and examples. Feel free to adapt these materials with anonymised data from your organisation.
