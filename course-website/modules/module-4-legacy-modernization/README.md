# Module 4 · Legacy Code Decomposition & Modernization

Explain legacy logic to stakeholders, co-create modern replacements, and capture risk decisions.

## Scenario

An overnight COBOL job calculates interest adjustments for deposit accounts. You will decompose the job, translate it to Python, and prepare a modernization brief.

## Objectives

1. Produce a plain-language walkthrough of the legacy routine.
2. Generate a Python module (plus tests) that mirrors the logic.
3. Complete a change-control log documenting risk, rollback, and approvals.

## What's Included

This module provides everything you need to complete the exercises:

- **COBOL Source Examples** – Legacy interest adjustment program for decomposition practice
- **Change-Control Log** – Template for documenting risks, rollbacks, and approvals
- **Modernization Guidance** – Steps for translating legacy logic to Python with tests

Review the Legacy Modernization Field Guide (Resources page) for decomposition worksheets and migration prompts. Work closely with risk and engineering reviewers before moving any modernization work forward.
