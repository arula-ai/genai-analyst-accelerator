# Requirements Workspace (Analyst Artifacts)

Use this folder for analyst artifacts onlyâ€”no code:

- Business-logic summary (plain English)
- Data & batch flow map (tables or Mermaid)
- Requirements package (fields, rules, acceptance criteria)
- SME question log and risk/assumption register

See `../README.md` for objectives and the change-control log requirements.
