# Module 4 Â· Legacy Code Decomposition & Modernization

Explain legacy logic to stakeholders, co-create modern replacements, and capture risk decisions.

## Scenario

An overnight COBOL job calculates interest adjustments for deposit accounts. You will decompose the job, translate it to Python, and prepare a modernization brief.

## Objectives

1. Produce a plain-language walkthrough of the legacy routine.
2. Generate a Python module (plus tests) that mirrors the logic.
3. Complete a change-control log documenting risk, rollback, and approvals.

## Toolkit Overview

- Study the legacy COBOL, JCL, and data layout directly in this module before you translate anything.
- Use the Python starter space and fixtures provided below to test refactors.
- Capture risk decisions using the change-control template embedded here, then download if you need a local record.

Work closely with risk and engineering reviewers before moving any modernization work forward.
