# Legacy Data Mapping Toolkit

Use these prompts and templates to translate COBOL routines into analyst-ready documentation.

## Key Artefacts
- `legacy-cobol-jcl-sample/` — Stand-alone repo template analysts can clone for Module 4 labs.
- `accelerator/module4_modernization/data-mapping/` — Workspace for storing discovery notes, flow diagrams, and requirements drafts.
- `course-website/homework/legacy-data-mapping.md` — Homework brief that guides the 30-minute mapping sprint.

## Suggested Prompts
1. `/explain` the COBOL program with business outcomes, decision branches, and data elements.
2. `/doc` a data flow table by referencing `@workspace module4_modernization/golden_dataset/sample_transactions.csv`.
3. `/doc` a modernization handoff summary that lists owners, SLAs, and acceptance criteria.

## Evidence Checklist
- Business logic summary stored alongside the COBOL source.
- Data flow map covering upstream sources, transformations, and downstream consumers.
- SME question log with owners, due dates, and risk ratings.
- Data requirements package ready for engineering review.

Revisit this toolkit whenever new legacy components enter the modernization pipeline.
