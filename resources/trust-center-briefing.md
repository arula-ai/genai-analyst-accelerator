# Copilot Trust Center Briefing

Use this 5-minute talk track before each cohort to reinforce data-handling expectations and reassure stakeholders.

## Key Talking Points
1. **Service Regions & Retention** – GitHub Copilot for Business requests are processed in GitHub-operated infrastructure. Prompts from Copilot Chat and CLI may be retained temporarily to provide the service but are excluded from training the public model.
2. **Enterprise Controls** – Public code filtering, organization-approved repositories, and policy controls let you govern where prompts are sent. Highlight how secret scanning and push protection backstop mistakes.
3. **Data Classifications** – Reiterate the accelerator rule: synthetic data only. If learners must discuss production context, anonymize it and avoid pasting credentials.
4. **Audit Evidence** – Every module captures validation logs, parity checks, and hallucination reports. Combined with the NIST crosswalk, this satisfies internal review requests.
