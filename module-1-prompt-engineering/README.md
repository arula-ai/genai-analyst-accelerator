# Module 1 Â· Prompt Engineering Essentials

Use this module to practise building prompts that produce trustworthy dataset summaries and SQL queries.

## Scenario

You have a synthetic transactions dataset (SynthRetail_Transactions.csv) previewed below. Stakeholders need a quick briefing and follow-up SQL to answer retention questions.

## Objectives

1. Craft prompts using the five-part blueprint (role, inputs, constraints, format, validation).
2. Generate SQL queries that answer stakeholder questions without hallucinating tables or columns.
3. Capture validation evidence in the SQL validation log before sign-off.

## Toolkit Overview

- Use the dataset preview and dictionary below to understand fields and grain.
- Refer to the prompt starter and validation log right in this module card.
- Download copies if you need to work offline or share with your cohort.

Feel free to replace the sample assets with anonymised data from your organisation once you are comfortable with the workflow.
