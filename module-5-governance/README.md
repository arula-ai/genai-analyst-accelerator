# Module 5 Â· Governance & Accuracy Fundamentals

Run accuracy programs that keep GenAI outputs safe, traceable, and audit-ready.

## Scenario

Your team receives AI-generated SQL, narratives, and code. Some outputs are intentionally flawed. The goal is to triage incidents, capture evidence, and escalate appropriately.

## Objectives

1. Diagnose hallucinations using the bias and validation checklists.
2. Record every decision in the accuracy register with supporting evidence.
3. Draft escalation messages for risk/compliance partners when severity is high.

## Toolkit Overview

- Update the accuracy register template embedded here as you progress through the lab.
- Practise with the incident reports and remediation notes directly within this module.
- Use the hallucination response worksheet and review checklist below; download copies if you need to circulate offline.

Update these artifacts with org-specific contacts and policies before running the program.
