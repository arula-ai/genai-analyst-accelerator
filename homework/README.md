| Assignment | Module | Focus | Duration | Output |

## Getting Started

1. Copy the templates referenced in each homework folder to your working directory.
2. Use synthetic data unless your governance team has approved real samples.
3. Store validation evidence and reviewer notes alongside each submission.

Submit artifacts through your team's review channel (SharePoint, GitHub repo, etc.) so facilitators can leave feedback.
