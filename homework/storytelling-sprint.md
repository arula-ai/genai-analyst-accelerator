# Homework: Executive Narrative Remix

**Module Alignment:** Module 3 – Insight Generation & Storytelling

## Goal

Use the Power BI executive pack to craft audience-specific narratives while capturing every evidence trail.

## Assets

- Dashboard pack: `resources/dashboards/power-bi-executive-pack/`
- Playbook: `resources/insight-storytelling-playbook.md`
- Briefing template: `resources/templates/insight-briefing.md`

## Deliverables

1. **Executive Briefing** – 300 words max using the Insight Briefing template.
2. **Operations Briefing** – Same data, adapted for the operations lead.
3. **Compliance Briefing** – Focus on risk, controls, and policy references.
4. **Evidence Table** – Shared across all narratives with metric IDs and filters.
5. **Fact-Check Log** – Record every validation step and reviewer outcome.

## Instructions

2. Draft the executive briefing with the story spine (context, insight, impact, action).

4. Populate the evidence table with metric IDs, values, and source visuals.
5. Run the fact-check prompts from the playbook and capture any issues in the log.
6. Package deliverables in `storytelling-sprint-<your-name>`.
