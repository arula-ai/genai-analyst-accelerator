# Module 1 Notebooks

Use this folder for DuckDB scratch work and explain-plan exports. Store `*.sql`, `*.duckdb`, or text explain plans referenced in `validation_log.csv`.

Suggested naming:
- `baseline_sales.sql` – prompt-generated query under review.
- `baseline_sales_explain.txt` – `EXPLAIN` output captured from DuckDB.
- `bias_checks.md` – notes about assumptions, bias flags, or reviewer comments.
