# Data Mapping Workspace

Use this folder to store:
- Business logic summaries (`*-business-logic.md`)
- Data flow diagrams or tables (`*-data-flow.csv|md`)
- SME question logs and risk registers (`*-questions.md`)
- Drafts of the data requirements package (`*-requirements.md`)

Keep filenames aligned with cohort initials or ticket numbers so downstream partners can locate artifacts quickly.
